Board: Pimoroni Inky Frame 5.7
Flashed with: 
MicroPython v1.21.0, inky_frame v1.21.0 on 2023-10-06; Raspberry Pi Pico W with RP2040

and via I2C connected: an Adafruit Gamepad QT (ID 5743)

(Test below done after some deletions of not used definitions in the module file: seesaw_gamepad_qt_mpy.py)

TODO: fine-tune time.sleep()'s to get a better response to button presses on the Gamepad QT.
      In this moment one has to press a button for too long time.
